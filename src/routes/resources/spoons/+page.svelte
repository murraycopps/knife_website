		My wooden products will be long lasting however they do require some maintenance. You cannot

		You should reapply whenever you notice that the wood is looking dull or dry or losing its water
		resistance. If you are using your spoon in warm water regularly you can opt to reapply a drying
		oil finish such as tung oil linseed oil or walnut oil however these take time to dry and cure
		and are often not food safe until they are completely dry. If you are not using it in hot water
		or would rather apply it more often and don't want to wait check out this board then I reccomend
