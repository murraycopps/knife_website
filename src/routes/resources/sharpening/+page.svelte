		Most of my knife sharpening knowlage comes from the youtube channel <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/@OUTDOORS55"

			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">OUTDOORS55</a
		>. His videos show the most important parts of knife sharpening in detail with close up images
		and good recommendations.
		<br />
		<br />
		Sharpening involves apexing the edge on a course stone, refining the edge with conistently finer
		stones, and then removing the burr with a combination of deburring passes and a strop.
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-oglala mt-2">Apexing</h2>
	<p class="text-2xl text-center text-white">
		Apexing is the process of having the bevels you sharpen meet in a point on the other side of the
		knife, you can tell this has happened when you raise a burr entirely along the edge and then
		switch sides and raise a burr on the other side.
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-oglala mt-2">Refining</h2>
	<p class="text-2xl text-center text-white">
		Refining is the process of using finer and finer stones to refine the edge, each finer stone can
		only need 5 passes in order to refine the scratch pattern left by the previous stone. This
		process can be carried to any point but I believe it is best to stop after 1,000 grid and it
		becomes less useful to go past 10,000 grid.
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-oglala mt-2">The Burr</h2>
	<p class="text-2xl text-center text-white">
		The burr is a small piece of metal which is so thin and flexible that it folds over the edge
		while sharpening. It often can be felt with your fingernail and you can feel sliding your finger
		off of one side of the edge will catch more then the other. This is a good thing while
		sharpening because it shows that the edge is apexed properly however it cannot be left on the
		edge as it will fold over and make the knife dull again.
		<br />
		<br />
		The burr can be removed by deburring passes, which are constantly lighter alternating passes with
		your final sharpening stone and a strop by doing light alternating passes backwards on the strop. It is important to not cut into the strop.

	<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-oglala mt-2">My Recommendations</h2>
	<p class="text-2xl text-center text-white">
		My ideal system is a set of two stones and two strops. I recommend a double sided diamond stone, <a

			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Sharpal 162N</a
		>
		and a double sided ceramic stone,
		<a
			href="https://fallkniven.se/en/knife/cc4/"
			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Fallkniven CC4</a
		>. The diamond stone can sharpen any steel to a high finish while the ceramic stone can refine
		most steels to a much higher finish, most steels do not require diamond stones but the high carbide steels do. The strops can
		be made from leather and wood, learn how here

			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Stropping Video</a
		>, This video covers everything you need to know about stropping. I use my strops with stropping
		compound from
		<a
			href="https://stroppystuff.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoozkxSOObNxewqWww3BwPM5d6zlU8hiWCbmkuoOBTVOzGDwO6O6"
			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Stroppy Stuff</a
		>, I use 6 microns after finishing on the sharpal stone or to touch up a dulling edge and I use
		1 micron after finishing with the CC4 or after I strop with the 6 micron compound.
		<br />
		<br />
		For the absolute cheapest solution I recommend a Fallkniven DC4 with a cheap stropping compound,
		it is a diamond stone on one side and a ceramic stone on the other. It is small and portable and
		can be used to sharpen any knife. 
		<a
			href="https://fallkniven.se/en/knife/dc4/"
			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Fallkniven DC4</a
		>,
		<a

			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Fallkniven Green Micro Fine Honing Compound</a
		>. This setup can be paired with a CC4 ceramic stone for
		refining the edge to a higher finish but it cannot sharpen high carbide steels like M4 or
		CPM 20CV so the expensive diamond stropping compound is not needed (it is still better for all steels the the green compound just not required). If pairing with the CC4 I would use this
		<a
			href="https://fallkniven.se/en/knife/fdd-foldable-diamond-ceramic-sharpener/"
			target="_blank"
			class="text-oglala-400 hover:text-oglala-300">Fallkniven FDD</a
		> which has a courser side then the DC4 replacing the finer side of the DC4 which is the same as the courser side of the CC4.
		<br	/>
		<br />
		While cheeper, the small pocket stones are harder to use and will not last as long as the larger sharpal stone so the higher initial cost can be worth it in the long run. The sharpal stone is also much more comfortable to use and has a larger surface area which makes it easier to sharpen larger knives.
